## Notes

    - Since i'm using a mock backend with fake data, the same responded json is used in each data unit, resulting in synchronized updating.
    - One way I could solve by creating a unique axios call for each control (x,y,z,diameter) and have the same amount of states as the combined length of all the features, but the principle remains the same.
